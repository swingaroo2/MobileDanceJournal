# JiveJournal

I am an active member and leader in my local swing dance community, and am active in scenes across the world. It is a truly wonderful hobby which has changed my life for the better.

The MobileDanceJournal iOS project, also known as JiveJournal, seeks to fill a specific niche: uniting practice notes and video. Typically these exist in separate media. Notes may be taken on pen and paper, while videos live in our devices, or on a file-hosting service like Google Drive.

The usecases of JiveJournal include:

* Regular practice sessions
* Classes at dance events
* Recording new move ideas

Future feature development includes:

* CloudKit integration for video storage
* Grouping practice sessions under dance events
* Sharing practice sessions (e.g. as lesson recaps)

Note: If you pull this repo, it comes with a flag that enables Core Data debug statements in the console. It can be toggled in the Edit Scheme Menu (Cmd + <) under the Arguments tab.
